Midterm evaluation of Project RNSO

Result: rHanso package. This is an R implementation of Matlab package Hanso. This also includes nclg package and Shor's R algorithm.

Weekly breakdown:

WK1 : linesearch
WK2 : BFGS
WK3 : Gradient sampling
WK4 : Hanso
WK5 : nlcg, shor's R

Comment: Modified some part of Hanso. Rversion can handle non smooth functions without requiring the user providing any numerical differentiation code. rHanso is equivalent to the latest version of Hanso (2.02).

Next Phase:

Implement SIDPSM
